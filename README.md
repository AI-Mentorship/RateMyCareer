## Project Description

RateMyCareer is an AI-driven, human-centered career platform that leverages Reddit's unfiltered career-related discussions which provide the emotional realities of various professions. While a majority of tools focus on objective data such as salary amounts, employment outlook, and job descriptions, this application focuses on the lived, emotional experiences of people working in those fields shared on Reddit.

## Features

- **Sentiment Aggregator & Trend Predictor:** Scrape career-related subreddits to gather posts and comments, analyze their sentiment, and track sentiment trends over time per career field; predict near-future sentiment using time-series models.
- **Vibe Score & Breakdown:** Calculate a composite “vibe score” rating for each career profession, integrating normalized sentiment, regret frequency, and volatility measure. The app will also feature a breakdown of the aforementioned metrics to the user.
- **AI-Generated Career Summaries:** Use large language models (LLMs) with clustering techniques to generate concise, human-readable summaries that describe what life is like in each profession, highlighting common themes, challenges, and required traits
