## Project Description
RateMyCareer is an AI-driven, human-centered career platform that leverages Reddit's unfiltered career-related discussions which provide the emotional realities of various professions. While a majority of tools focus on objective data such as salary amounts, employment outlook, and job descriptions, this application focuses on the lived, emotional experiences of people working in those fields shared on Reddit.

## Features
- **Sentiment Aggregator & Trend Predictor:** Scrape career-related subreddits to gather posts and comments, analyze their sentiment, and track sentiment trends over time per career field; predict near-future sentiment using time-series models.
- **Career Sentiment & Regret Dashboard:** Visualize historical emotional sentiment, frequency of regret-related posts, and confidence metrics for various professions
- **Top Movers List:** Identify careers with rapidly improving or declining emotional sentiment, measured by an “emotional volatility index”
- **Final Vibe Score:** Calculate a composite “vibe score” rating (0–5 stars) for each career field, integrating normalized sentiment, regret frequency, and volatility measures
- **AI-Generated Career Summaries:** Use large language models (LLMs) with clustering techniques to generate concise, human-readable summaries that describe what life is like in each profession, highlighting common themes, challenges, and required traits
